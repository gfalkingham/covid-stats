Covid Stats
===========

This is a simple python program to read a summary of `newCasesByPublishDate` from the UK Governmentâ€™s COVID-19 data in CSV format.

Data is obtained from the API here: - https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/details/developers-guide

The CSV file is populated with the following two fields: 

* date
* newCasesByPublishDate

Nb. The number of 'new cases by publish date' is for the whole United Kingdom, and is not broken down by nation.
